# This script is designed to help you test the Knapsack lab automatically
#
# It is meant to run in the top directory that has c, java, python, and data as subdirectories
#
# Run as (for exmaple)
#
# bash test.sh java
#
# This script requires bash 4.0 so if you're on a Mac then you'll need to upgrade your version of
# bash e.g. using macports or homebrew
# 
# You can edit the script to change the time limit to use on each input problem.
# Just edit the times array below
#
# IF YOU ARE USING PYTHON then you will definitely need to increase the time limits
#
# You may want to edit the algs and inputs arrays to run a subset of the experiments.
#
# If your code is failing the tests then check that QUIET is not 1 in your code e.g. that it is
# printing things out. This script greps the output.
#
# For branch-and-bound you want the script to capture the best solution found 'so far'. To do this 
# you shoould print using printf("Current best solution=%d\n", current_best) or similar as the script
# is matching against output of this form
#
# You will get one of four outputs from the correctnes checks:
# Yes means it was correct 
# No means it was incorrect
# ?  means that we are not expecting an optimal solution so cannot check that we've got one.
# - means that it timed out. Sometimes this is the expected behaviouor.
#
# When might you get ?
# Branch and bound will only give a `best-effort' on the hard problems within any realistic time limit. 
# Part of the exercise involves explaining why the greedy approach always has a ‘?‘
